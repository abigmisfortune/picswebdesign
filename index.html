    <h2> Inspiration </h2>
    <p> When I was maybe less than fifteen years old, I listened to the whole album of <i>Baby One More Time</i>
        and thought it was really catchy. I was especially drawn to <i> Email My Heart </i>. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Before that, the only Songs
        from <i> Britney Spears</i> that I knew was <i>Criminal</i> and <i>Till the World Ends</i>. That was where my
        knowledge of her songs stopped for a while till the pandemic came. 
        <br/>
        <br/>
        For some reason, during mid September, I heard this thing called the
       <i>#freebritney</i> movement. I did some research and it was apparently about her 13 year conservatorship battle
       against her own father, <i> Jamie Spears</i>.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       She was apparently abused to overwork by her own family just for money. She wasn't allowed to have control over
       her finances or most life choices. 
       <br/>
       <br/>
       Of course, a conservatorship is meant to protect people with mostly physical and mental limitations, but it didn't
       make sense that someone with those sort of limitation would be overworked to depression. 
       <br/>
       <br/>
       I felt sorry for her and curious at the kind of person she was, I guess. That was when I started watching more of
       her music videos. I ended up getting drawn to her stage presence whenever she performed. I loved the confidence She
       would show. 
       <br/>
       <br/>
       At that point, I grew to admire her. It was no longer just pity. I genuinely liked her music and performances. Yes, 
       the conservatorship and the abuse was horrible, but that was only one portion of her life. There are lots of wonderful
       things to celebrate and admire.

            <h2>Materials</h2>
            <p> Truthfully, I wanted imitate the kind of arts and crafts Jean Jullien makes while still maintaining my drawing
                style. I actually did not have that many art materials and I had a long way to go when it came to innovative art. if you see
                the images below, you'll see what made me fell in love with his arts and crafts. I was actually pretty much inspired by him through
                one of the required reaction papers for my Graphic Communication subject.

            <p> In the end, I settled for these materials: <br/>
                sketchpad paper <br/>
                drawing pen <br/>
                color pencils <br/>
                crepe paper <br/>
                art markers <br/>
                glitters (for the first one)
